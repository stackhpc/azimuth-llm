huggingface:
  # The name of the HuggingFace model to use
  model: tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct
  # Other (partially tested) options:
  # (some of which may not fit on a single GPU and will take a long time to download)
  # - meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf #Â Requires licence token
  # - tiiuae/falcon-40b # Weights ~160GB disk size
  # - bigscience/bloom # Weights were trending towards ~360GB disk size

  # For private/gated huggingface models (e.g. Meta's Llama models) 
  # you must provide your own huggingface token, for details see:
  # https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens
  
  # To do this, either provide the name of an existing secret on the cluster,
  # which should be created before installing this chart by running 
  # `kubectl create secret generic huggingface-token --from-env-file <file-name>`
  # where <file-name> is a file with the following contents:
  # HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=<token-value>
  secretName:
  # OR FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY, you can instead provide the secret directly
  # as a chart value here (if secretName is set about then it will take priority)
