The LLM chatbot app allows users to deploy machine learning models from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models) and interact with them through a simple web interface. 
See the [chart README](https://github.com/stackhpc/azimuth-llm/) for more information.

Note: This target Kubernetes cluster must have a GPU worker node group configured, otherwise the deployment will remain in a pending state until a GPU node becomes available for scheduling.

On first deployment, the app must download the weights for the specified model from Huggingface. 
This can take a significant amount of time depending on model choice and network speeds.
Download progress can be monitored by inspecting the logs for the LLM API pod via the Kubernetes Dashboard for the target cluster.

The app use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) as a model serving backend and [gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) as a web interface. The official list of Huggingface models supported by vLLM can be found [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).
