The LLM chatbot app allows users to deploy machine learning models from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models) and interact with them through a simple web interface. 

On first deployment, the app must download the weights for the specified model from Huggingface. 
Depending on model choice these weights can be tens or hundreds of GB in size; therefore, depending on network speeds, the initial deployment can take a significant amount of time. 
Download progress can be monitored by inspecting the logs for the LLM API pod via the Kubernetes Dashboard for the target cluster.

The app use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) as a model serving backend and [gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) as a web interface. For official list of Huggingface models supported by vLLM see https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html
